The\r\nintended use case is to visualize parallel compilation runs, and how\r\nthey use cpu and ram.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUsing the program simply amounts to checking out the git repo and\r\nrunning:\r\n\r\n    /path/to/graphpg [command]\r\n\r\nThis then executes the command, samples resource usage about once\r\nevery second, and then draws a plot when the command is finished.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFor example, rebuilding the [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) library:\r\n\r\n    /path/to/graphpg sage -ba\r\n\r\nyields the following graph on a quad-core machine:\r\n\r\n![Sage Build Output](example.svg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
